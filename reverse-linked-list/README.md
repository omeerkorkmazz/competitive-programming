Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to reverse this list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6

Output: 6 5 4 3 2 1

Explanation: After reversing the list, 
elements are 6->5->4->3->2->1.

Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 2->7->8->9->10

Output: 10 9 8 7 2

Explanation: After reversing the list,
elements are 10->9->8->7->2.

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function reverseList() with head reference as the only argument and should return new head after reversing the list.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^4
