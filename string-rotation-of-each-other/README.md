Given two strings s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1. The characters in the strings are in lowercase.

Example 1:

Input:
geeksforgeeks
forgeeksgeeks

Output: 
1

Explanation: s1 is geeksforgeeks, s2 is forgeeksgeeks. Clearly, s2 is a rotated version of s1 as s2 can be obtained by left-rotating s1 by 5 units.
 

Example 2:

Input:
mightandmagic
andmagicmigth

Output: 
0

Explanation: Here with any amount of rotation s2 can't be obtained by s1.
 

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function areRotations() which checks if the two strings are rotations of each other. The function returns true if string 1 can be obtained by rotating string 2, else it returns false.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Space Complexity: O(N).
Note: N = |s1|.

 

Constraints:
1 <= |s1|, |s2| <= 10^7
